# Cyparta-Page
The goal of this project is to develop a streamlined web application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, featuring a user-friendly interface and modern design. The application will consist of two main pages—a login page and a profile page—and will include a static sidebar for seamless navigation between these pages.
